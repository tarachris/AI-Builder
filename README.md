Protection
Fiber-Shield®
Stain Treatments
Costikyan offers a variety of exclusive advanced treatments that are designed to protect a diverse range of fabrics and carpets from waterborne, oil-borne, and soilborne stains.

Costikyan Exclusive

Stain Treatments
Our Fiber-Shield®, Faux-Shield, and Sisal-Shield textile protectors are a practical and cost-effective approach to getting the most out of any furnishing investment. Try them out to effectively:

Repel liquid, soil, and oils

Reduce wear and tear and fading

Improve clean ability and extend time between cleanings

Provide static control and act as a disinfectant

Fiber-Shield®
Textile Protection
Available exclusively through Costikyan, Fiber-Shield® textile protector protects the integrity of fabric and extends the life of your valuable furnishings. It can be applied within 10-30 minutes to all types of soft surfaces: fabric and leather upholstery, rugs, carpeting, window treatments, and wall coverings without changing texture or appearance. 

Fiber-Shield®
Advantage
Fiber-Shield® textile protector is not a surface coating but an example of the latest chemical technology utilizing crosslinking of new age polymers to fibers. Each fiber is impregnated with millions of string-like fluorochemical umbrellas that surround each fiber in a protective barrier. The protection does not readily break down with use or cleaning. Fiber-Shield® protection is uniform throughout each fiber and does not change the breathability of the material. 

Fiber-Shield®
For Designers
Fiber-Shield® textile protector provides stronger resistance than any other protector available and is used by hundreds of interior designers and architects. It is accepted by the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) who rely on Costikyan as an authorized applicator of Fiber-Shield®.
